# Description

In this page, I provide references to the libraries that could help in architecting an Android Application. For example, a dependency injection library like dagger.

## Libraries

### [Dagger](https://dagger.dev/)

Dagger is a fully static, compile-time dependency injection framework for both Java and Android. It is an adaptation of an earlier version created by Square and now maintained by Google. [1]
