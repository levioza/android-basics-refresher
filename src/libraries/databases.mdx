# Description

In this page, I provide references to the libraries that could help in storing data in a local database.

## Libraries

### [Realm Java](https://realm.io/docs/java/latest)

Realm Database is an alternative to SQLite. Thanks to its zero-copy design, Realm Database is much faster than an ORM, and often faster than raw SQLite. Get started in minutes, not hours. [1]

### [Room Persistence Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room)

The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite. [2]
