# Description

In this page, I provide references to the libraries that could help in performing http requests to webservices or GraphQL-based server.

## Libraries

### [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)

A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java. [1]

### [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/)

OkHttp is an HTTP client thatâ€™s efficient. [2]

### [Apollo Android](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android)

Apollo-Android is a GraphQL compliant client that generates Java and Kotlin models from standard GraphQL queries. These models give you a typesafe API to work with GraphQL servers. Apollo will help you keep your GraphQL query statements together, organized, and easy to access. Change a query and recompile your project - Apollo code gen will rebuild your data model. Code generation also allows Apollo to read and unmarshal responses from the network without the need of any reflection. [3]
